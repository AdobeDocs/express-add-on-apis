# Adobe Express Add-ons: API References
API References for use when building Adobe Express add-ons.

## Overview
Here you will find a set of API References to use with your Adobe Express add-on development.

### Authoring APIs
The Authoring APIs allow you to perform authoring functions like creating shapes and accessing other high-level API features that are inherent to the Adobe Express editor. The [Editor](../pages/api/classes/Editor.md) class is the main entry point into the Authoring APIs.
